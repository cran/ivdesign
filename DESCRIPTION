Title: Hypothesis Testing in Cluster-Randomized Encouragement Designs
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Bo Zhang
Maintainer: Bo Zhang <bozhan@wharton.upenn.edu>
Description: An implementation of randomization-based hypothesis 
    testing for three different estimands in a cluster-randomized 
    encouragement experiment. The three estimands include (1) testing
    a cluster-level constant proportional treatment effect (Fisher's
    sharp null hypothesis), (2) pooled effect ratio, and (3) average 
    cluster effect ratio. To test the third estimand, user needs to install
    'Gurobi' (>= 9.0.1) optimizer via its R API. Please refer to 
    <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/refman/ins_the_r_package.html>.
